# Werdd

## Description
HankoAcademy project.  

The Werdd app is an app made for those who want new words added to their vocabulary, as well as having a dictionary available in their pocket at all times!

Users can search a specific word, scroll through the different definitions, and select each word to see more details (synonyms, antonyms and example sentences). Any of the definitions can be added and saved to their favorites list. Users can also have the app randomly generate a word and can save any of those results to their favorites list.
