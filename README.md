# Werdd

## Description
HankoAcademy project.  

The Werdd app is an app made for those who want new words added to their vocabulary, as well as having a dictionary available in their pocket at all times!

##Version Requirements
**V1:** Display one word with its definition only.  
**V2:** Random word generator: Add a button that will randomly display another word.
(have a big array somewhere where you can randomly select a word to display, basically stub out the data). 
**V3:** Display all words in a tableview underneath the random word generator. use a standard UITableViewCell. 
**V4:** Make a custom UITableViewCell subclass. 
**V5:** Tapping on a word goes to a detail view (navigation controller). Separate branch of the same app, but with a collectionView. 
**V6:** Connect random word logic to the random word API. Add search to the table view and make a networking call. Display fetched results in the tableview. Display fetched result in the detailview when tableviewcell is tapped.  
**V7:** Add button to favorite random word, or a searched word in the detail view. Ability to see a tableview of your favorite words with a new viewcontroller (button to navigate from the top right). 
**V8:** Use principles of MVC, POP, etc and refactor your app to be cleaner just in general.
